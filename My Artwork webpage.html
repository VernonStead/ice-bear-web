      <img src="images/polar bear jets.PNG" alt="Polar Bear Jets"> 
       <p>I was working on an art project last semseter im pretty sure and when i finished i wanted to continue using stipling.So i decided i was going to draw a polar bear, and sense i really like hoodies i decided id give him a hoodie why not. Im also not very good at drawing feet so i decided to give im rocket jets for legs.</p>

       <img src="images/eyescape.PNG" alt="eyescape">
       <p>I was told to do a practice draft using a human body part in a landscape. So i decided to make an eye like a lake changing universes as it flips over. And i am pretty happy with this picture i made it in like 2023 and im still very proud of it.</p>

      <h5>Scared Bear</h5>
      <img src="images/Burnt Bear.PNG" alt="Burnt Bear">
      <p>With this drawing, its actually one of my favorites like ever. I was wanting to draw a polar bear standing up because i really love drawing polar bears. I also really enjoy putting different styles of horns on to creatures that dont typically have horns. I also found out i really enjoy make things destroyed like falling apart or expolading in my drawings so i was really happy with the horns and halo i gave him too. An with the burn scars, i Love putting those onto creatures because it adds more detail and story into the picture. I got kinda decent at drawing the burn scars after looking at someones explanintion on how to shade and draw the scars. I would also actively study closly to how my wounds and scars would heal because it gave me more of a realistic understanding on what stage of the healing process i should give the creature. This drawing Its got a good amount of issues i could go back in and fix but i would also risk it looking worse so im happy with were it stands.</p>
